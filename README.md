# Super simple focus app

Inspired the classic pomadoro technique, this app also allows the user to input the thing one is focussed on. This helps to additionally focus the mind, forcing the user to really commit to their decision to prioritise that single thing for the specified amount of time.

## Scripts

`yarn && yarn start`

## Next steps

- [ ] Build in randomness to the alerts that break the focus
